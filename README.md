# Hybrid in office days requirement
In a hybrid office sometimes staff are given a percentage as to the amount of time during a given month that they need to be in the office. This calculates the number of days a staff member needs to be in the office based on that percentage.

## default month

By default next month is displayed.
If you need a different month just change the month or year.

## holidays

The weekdays are shown for the selected month, but that doesn't account for holidays. Add any holidays and vacation days to the box that you will not be working during the month. You could add sick days too.

Fractional days are allowed as well. For example if you know you will be on vacation for 3 and a half days then you can put 3.5 in the Holidays and Vacations day field.

## Percent in-office

This is the percent of working time that staff are expected to be in the office. It defaults to 40 meaning 40%. This number can be edited to be any percent you want.

## days in office result

After the days in office is calculated it is rounded the the whole day rather than giving a fractional result.
